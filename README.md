## Prerequisites

Modules (see requirements.txt) : `bs4`, `requests`,  `tqdm`, `urllib==1.26.16`, `colorama` and `tk`*

Python version : 3.6 and above

Run:

```
pip install bs4 requests tqdm urllib==1.26.16 colorama tk
```

or 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt`
```

## Usage (see Examples folder)

for a basic usage, you can just do :

```python
from tkinter import Tk 
from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename, askdirectory
from schoolmouv.Webscrap import WebScrap
import os 

path = askdirectory()
os.chdir(path=path)
course = "https://www.schoolmouv.fr/cours/les-caracteristiques-du-capitalisme-des-annees-1920-/fiche-de-cours" # PDF
WebScrap.scrap(url=course, is_pdf=True, overwrite=False, path=os.getcwd())
course = "https://www.schoolmouv.fr/cours/les-caracteristiques-du-capitalisme-des-annees-1920-/cours-video" # Vid√©o
WebScrap.scrap(url=course, is_pdf=False, overwrite=False, path=os.getcwd())
```

## Step by step

if you have git and know how to use it, you can just clone the repository and use it like you want 

```
git clone https://github.com/Rayster4/Unofficial-SchoolMouv-Extended
```

Otherwise, if you are not familiar with git nor python : 

- Download the branch by using the **Download zip** button under the green `<> code` button. <br />

- Extract the filde downloaded in a folder

- open a **terminal** in the folder with all files (windows button -> 'cmd')

```cmm
cd C:\the_folder
```

- Just **run** the main.py :)

```cmd
python main.py
```

There is also a executable but windows seems to have taken a grudge against it, so, it's up to you.
